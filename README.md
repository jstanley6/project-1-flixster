### Notes

There are still challenges associated with part 2 that I am working on. I am dealing with figuring out how to overlay an image over the trailer and using slide transitional elements to create a nice transition for when the intent is being called. I am also working on more of the UI to make it look even better. I also need to check into the Butterknife annotation and add rounded corners to the overlay image to make it look better.

### Notes
The beginning of the flixster app went successfully and no major problems with the Api, everything seemed to compile properly and 
nothing major needed fixed. I had to change the app emulator to auto-rotate but that was a small detail that needed fixed.
